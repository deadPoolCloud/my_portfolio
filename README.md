3. Work Examples
Since you might not have permission to share actual work examples from projects, here are some alternative ways to showcase your skills:

Homework and Course Projects: Include any relevant projects or assignments you completed during your QA training at QSpiders Kolkata. If you've automated tests or created test cases for certain scenarios, you can show those.

Self-Tested Web/Mobile Apps: Share links to personal projects where you tested websites or mobile apps, explaining your approach to functional and regression testing, as well as how you handled bug reporting.

Open API Testing: If you've tested open APIs, provide documentation or a video demonstrating your approach to API testing, including how you validated different endpoints for both REST and SOAP services.
